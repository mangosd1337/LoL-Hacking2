	  	   <h1>Welcome!</h1>
	  	   <p class="lead">
	  	   	This utility will convert all the tables in your community database to UTF-8 without deleting or overwriting your existing data.
	  	   </p>
      </div>
      <h3>Installing</h3>
      <p>
      	Simply upload the directory <code>utf8convert</code> to your community root directory.
      </p>
      <h3>How it works</h3>
      <p>
      	The converter will create new tables with the prefix "x_utf_". The converter will read your existing data, convert it to UTF-8 and then save it into the "x_utf_" prefixed tables.
      </p>
      <p>
      	Once the data conversion has taken place, you can test the conversion by editing your <code>conf_global.php</code> file to alter the <code>sql_tbl_prefix</code> and to make sure that the <code>sql_charset</code> is set to <code>utf8</code>. The exact instructions for this
      	are shown when the conversion has finished.
      </p>
      <p>
      	Once you are happy that the conversion is correct, you are prompted to <strong>finish</strong> the conversion. This will rename your existing database tables with the prefix "orig_" and the UTF-8 tables
      	will be renamed to your existing prefix. You are then prompted again to edit your <code>conf_global.php</code> file to alter the <code>sql_tbl_prefix</code>.
      </p>
      <p>
      	You can then delete the "orig_" prefixed tables when you are happy that the conversion is complete and the original unconverted data is no longer required.
      </p>
      <h3>Web or command line?</h3>
      <p>
      	This converter is available with two interfaces. There is a <strong>web</strong> version that you can launch using the button below.
      	<br />
      	The preferred method is to use the command line version. If you have shell access with your hosting account, then please launch the shell converter interface by using <code>cd</code> to navigate to
      	your community root and then run <code>php cli.php</code> and follow the onscreen prompts. If you are running from the Windows command prompt or your shell client does not support colors, then run <code>php cli.php --basic</code>.
      </p>
